# Face_Forensics_videos_preprocessing_with_multiprocessing
This repository contains an optimized code for preprocessing videos from the FaceForensics++ (F++) dataset. By leveraging multiprocessing, the code efficiently extracts target faces from videos using corresponding masked videos as guides.

The left image shows that there are two faces in a video frame however using the masks provided by the FaceForensics++ dataset on the right. The target face can be extracted.
