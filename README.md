# Face_Forensics_videos_preprocessing_with_multiprocessing
This repository contains an optimized code for preprocessing videos from the FaceForensics++ (F++) dataset. By leveraging multiprocessing, the code efficiently extracts target faces from videos using corresponding masked videos as guides.

In the left image, there are two faces present within a video frame. However, by utilizing the masks provided by the FaceForensics++ dataset (as shown on the right), we can precisely extract the target face.
